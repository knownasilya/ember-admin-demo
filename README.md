# ember-admin-demo

Application using an engine version of [ember-admin] to
show how this could be done and to experiment with what's currently
possible. This loads the ember-admin engine lazilly.

See the ember-admin [fork].

## TODO

- [ ] Figure out how to bring back theme functionality, ala [ember-admin-bootstrap].
